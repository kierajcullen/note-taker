# Note Taker

This application will write, save and delete notes using express to send and retrieve user data. API routes were used to easily create API endpoints a Node.js serverless functions.

Run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies. To use the application locally, run node server.js in your CLI, and then open http://localhost:3000 in your preferred browser. The Note Taker app is live on Heroku (will be.. it might be, need to confirm that actually).
